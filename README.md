## FlowSimulation
A simple flow simulation within a random three-dimensional block system.

Requirements: Java has to be installed

Instructions:
  1. Download all the files in this repository to a single directory.
  2. Open a terminal in that directory and run the command 'javac *.java'
  3. Finally you can run the command 'java FlowSimulation n p'
    (n = amount of blocks in a row, p = probability of a space being occupied)

The following image was produced with the command 'java FlowSimulation 10 0.6'
(n = 10, p = 0.6)
