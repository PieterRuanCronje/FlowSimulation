## FlowSimulation
A simple flow simulation within a random three-dimensional block system.

Requirements: Java installation

Instructions:
  1. Download all the files in this repository to a single directory.
  2. Open a terminal in that directory and run the command 'javac *.java'
  3. Run the command 'java FlowSimulation n p'

(n = amount of blocks in a row, p = probability of a space being occupied)

The following images were produced with the commands:
  -java FlowSimulation 10 0.6
  -java FlowSimulation 100 0.65
